In this dashboard, by selecting the distance and a specific train station, the properties and the price range per square meter are shown on the map. I used those Python libraries: osmnx to get geometries of buildings and train stations, geopandas to do all GIS operations, pydeck and altair for map and graph respectively and streamlit to create dashboard...hope you like it
